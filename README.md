# Chat-GPT-API
This project is a simple web application that interacts with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate responses based on user input. The application consists of an input field where users can type their queries and a "Send" button to submit the input. The response from the GPT-4 model is then displayed on the web page.

Features:
User Input Field: Allows users to type their queries.
Send Button: Submits the user input to the GPT-4 model. The button is hidden until the user types something in the input field.
Response Display: Shows the response from the GPT-4 model on the web page.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the web page.
JavaScript: For handling user interactions and making API requests.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.
How It Works:
User Input: The user types a query into the input field.
Button Visibility: The "Send" button is hidden until the user types something in the input field.
API Request: When the "Send" button is clicked, the input is sent to the OpenAI GPT-4 model via an API request.
Response Handling: The response from the GPT-4 model is displayed on the web page.
This project demonstrates a basic integration with the OpenAI API and provides a simple interface for users to interact with the GPT-4 model.
